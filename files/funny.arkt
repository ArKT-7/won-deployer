💡 btw In the meantime, here are some highly recommended activities 💀:
Brew a strong Tea/Chai (you’ll need it)
Watch India’s Got Latent (no relation to system latency... hopefully)
Dig a tunnel to your WiFi router and ask it why
Try whistling with your mouth closed — surprise bonus: confusion
Reflect on this truth: 'Life has no Ctrl + Z'
Feeling philosophical? DM your thoughts to @ArKT_7 ️

🔫 Still waiting? Congrats, you’ve unlocked: 'Patience Simulator 2025' lol!
